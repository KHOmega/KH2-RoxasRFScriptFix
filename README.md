# KH2-RoxasRFScriptFix
### This is an unofficial patch! I'm not a dev for KH Re:Fined nor TieuLink's Roxas!
Restores the text for Re:Fined features, plus minor edits for TieuLink's Roxas mod. Place this ABOVE all of the Roxas mods, but BELOW any mods that change the Dodge Roll abilities' names.
I had to trace a bitmap of Roxas's symbol for that icon I hope you're happy LMAO
